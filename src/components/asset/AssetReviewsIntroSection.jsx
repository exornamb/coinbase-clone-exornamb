            Once an asset meets our business criteria, we may choose to move forward with a due
            diligence review. If we need additional information in order to complete an initial
            review or have updates to share, we will reach out to the project team directly.

            If your project has a live token (or is considering launching a token) and feels it’s
            a strong fit for our platform and customer base, we invite you to share more details
            with us.
